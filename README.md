# Alchemy University: JavaScript Fundamentals

This repository is solely meant to be a practice playground for the [Alchemy University - JavaScript Fundamentals Course](https://university.alchemy.com/). As someone fortunate enough to have been granted early access I decided to go through the JavaScript Fundamentals Course, as a refresher and scouting for areas the material can be improved before diving into the Ethereum Developer Bootcamp.

Do not expect file or folder names to stay the same within this repository. As stated this repository is solely meant to be a practice area that tracks my activity on GitHub for would be employers.
